# Fullstack Starter

This is a starter project bootstrapped with the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/). It provides a solid foundation for building modern, full-stack web applications.

## Design Philosophy

This starter is designed to be **minimalist and production-ready**. The goal is to provide just enough structure to get you started quickly, without imposing rigid design choices or unnecessary complexity.

- **Ready to Use**: Comes with a complete authentication system (sign-up, login, password reset), database integration, and email services pre-configured.
- **Easy to Customize**: Includes only essential pages and components. No extra UI libraries are bundled, allowing you to bring your own or build from scratch.
- **Fully Type-Safe**: End-to-end type safety from your database to your frontend, powered by TypeScript and Zod.
- **Modern Stack**: Built on the Next.js App Router, ensuring you start with the latest web development standards.
- **Dark Mode Included**: A pre-configured, theme-able dark mode is ready to go.
